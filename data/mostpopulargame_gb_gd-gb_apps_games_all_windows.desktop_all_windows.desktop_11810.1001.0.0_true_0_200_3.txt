Touch to position the ball, and then swipe your finger to roll it. Tilt or swipe your finger to add spin.\r\n★ 100 pin challenge, iron pin, and spares mode!\r\n★ Candlepin, Duckpin, Five Pin, Skittles, and Nine Pin bowling variations! These have new pin types, balls, rules, and challenges.\r\n★ Beautiful 3D graphics. Reflective lanes and shiny bowling balls look great on any device.\r\n★ Online leaderboards.\r\n\r\nUnlock new planet-themed balls, conquer challenging achievements, and complete your voyage of the solar system.\r\n\r\nCan you reach Pluto?\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowl includes:\r\n\r\nTEN PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular bowling games in the world today. Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NH0XDJF9KBZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Secret Order 6: Bloodline","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10409.13635099483728242.7c8681c1-59eb-4965-b4a3-bbe05a262cbc.eff68e69-a1b8-465d-be6e-c36428334109","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56505.13635099483728242.75290579-e779-4077-8470-38a44cd8c870.29c851b4-7e7e-42a1-9615-1da72c5f50c6","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14028.13635099483728242.c13c4887-93bf-405a-aa44-8e286b1ce10b.75936e87-89ec-474a-aedd-de36a950db99","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"22","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.TheSecretOrder6Bloodline_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["4858481a-65ec-b449-db15-60a86da2cb55","466147d1-a214-a66d-b6e4-2eacd64de2eb","7bfbdfb2-79ee-229b-1cae-90377e6e4254","d4232c3e-9da5-5b33-3660-d0ae230d1d77"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"LIMITED TIME OFFER!

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins. Arnar gives his younger son a mission to find a dwarf and return the ring. \r\nThe Vikings sailed to the setting sun for many days, until the storm scattered their drakkar on the shores of some island. They were lucky, it was the island they were looking for. Travel with Ingolf along the picturesque lands, help the locals solve their problems, make friends with a wise Druid and, most importantly, find Loki to deliver the Viking king from the curse of the ring! \r\n\r\nJOIN US! \r\n\r\nEnjoy Realore Games at: http://www.realore.com \r\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealoreGame \r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealoreGames \r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.realore.com/appprivacypolicy.php","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P2STCLNBKKL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO SUPER SIDEKICKS 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11440.14556049817555107.cfbc3f37-92c3-47c4-9e43-52ee5642c724.93c6f3b0-0c54-4f40-8880-011f24785823","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46971.14556049817555107.cfbc3f37-92c3-47c4-9e43-52ee5642c724.739ddf70-fdf5-4d3b-9f31-4d0b506f97c6","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48023.14556049817555107.cfbc3f37-92c3-47c4-9e43-52ee5642c724.295aea31-4936-4b36-ac26-833ce50a103e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6910.14556049817555107.cfbc3f37-92c3-47c4-9e43-52ee5642c724.08541285-b187-49da-98e1-056fbb8c824f","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38307.14556049817555107.cfbc3f37-92c3-47c4-9e43-52ee5642c724.19213ff7-d5bc-40ea-8be3-6e0a4db55daf","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£6.09","Price":6.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOSUPERSIDEKICKS2_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["5baf20dd-adb7-8f2a-7ed4-105d1ea92081"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SUPER SIDEKICKS 2 is a soccer game released in 1994 by SNK.

Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3G0R0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Trial X Trials","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8681.13510798884251509.e5aea8e0-7e34-4eee-86cb-d3506670bf35.332c4f85-c862-43a0-9371-0755529c9651","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43919.13510798884251509.c720beba-e584-4c48-97ab-bb190a4b5179.77a402d2-47a0-44c0-9e8a-767058183b4e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£0.79","Price":0.79,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["22888TiagoSerra.TrialXTrials_1yfk2erpp42jy"],"ContentIds":["30757786-7433-301e-80b5-66ffffeb8a0a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Trial X Trials is the ultimate Trial Racing Game for Windows, the hit game on iOS and Google Play finally made it's way to  Windows Store.\r\n\r\nSUPPORTS Touchscreen !!!or Keyboard!!!!, you decide\r\n\r\nTrial X Trials is the successor of  my previous work Trial Extreme 1 2 3 and 4 available on the most popular mobile platforms.\r\n\r\nTrial X Trials it's a simple yet addictive mobile game with the visual breakthroughs of the next generation of gaming.

The goal of the game is to take as many tricks as possible and reach a score of 10 or more first. The game is played in pairs. Your partner sits opposite to you and the deals are played clockwise.

If the trump is chosen in the first round you receive the trump card and must shed any card you wish.\r\n✓\tThe player next to the dealer in a clock-wise direction is the first to choose a trump suit. \r\n✓\tIf that player passes the chance, the next one after him follows.\r\n✓\tThe game is played between two teams: a top-bottom team comprised of you and a computer player and a left-right team of computer players.\r\n✓\tThe player and his partner are called the makers if one of them chooses a trump suit.

Otherwise if the team takes 3 or 4 tricks it scores only 1 point.\r\n✓\tThere is a specific order of the trump cards. The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit. \r\n✓\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9. \r\n✓\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit.\r\n✓\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9.\r\n✓\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit.\r\n✓\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit.\r\n✓\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit.\r\n✓\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points.\r\n✓\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made.\r\n✓\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre.\r\n✓\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred.\r\n✓\tThe makers are marked with an M. The player that chose the trump is marked with a bold M.\r\n✓\tThe defenders are marked with a D.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial:

Try Curling3D anyway and you’ll fall in love with curling and our game.\r\n\r\nCurling3D is one of the best curling simulation games for one or two players. Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.\r\n\r\nCurling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.\r\n\r\nTry it… you won’t be disappointed.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH0M29L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"RC-AirSim - RC Model Airplane Flight Sim","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44196.13510798883137495.a08aa33e-bcc7-4c9a-a504-9762af34a35b.62140bd8-8ee4-4326-9cc2-338f17842896","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48066.13510798883137495.12ebe799-fb96-424e-b334-082bfb676f8e.824ab522-7e0a-476c-a37a-58236b2adc1f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41031.13510798883137495.d32391c1-bfd8-4f09-8557-f49dbc011d44.0d264f23-c7c6-4e13-ba23-98a90bfc8932","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48737.13510798883137495.98cd0211-772f-4d2f-bd6d-16dc4fe2f421.d65ed048-059d-4813-8020-4aa9f3804555","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61993.13510798883137495.b47e72c3-1080-458f-b407-505fc15f5525.26bd8296-40c4-4c7d-a8ec-2c14949e244e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62112.13510798883137495.35c7bc0b-35c3-4589-8f84-c9b7920073fb.0d643670-7e73-4f2b-ba47-89fb24090ba2","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":0.0,"PackageFamilyNames":["47179FabricatedReality.RC-AirSim-RCModelAirplaneFl_s06pkavjfgen8"],"ContentIds":["567eea44-4aa9-bb5e-8aa0-20d61ec7888b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Learn to fly r/c model airplanes with this advanced realistic flight simulator!

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Your heroes are trained to use scrolls, which can turn the tide of battle in the blink of an eye. Summon the undead or powerful golems, lead your opponents into a rain of fire or a toxic cloud, and awaken their rage.\r\nIn each of the campaigns you have a castle at your disposal. You can expand it according to your preferred fighting style. Upgrade your heroes and your favorite units, and improve teleports to gain an edge on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nACCESSIBLE AND COMPLEX STRATEGY GAME\r\n● A turn-based strategy game with simple and clear rules and a tactical depth, thanks to which you can adjust the gameplay style to your individual preferences.\r\n● Complete four captivating single-player campaigns with unique heroes, units, and enemies.\r\n● Use the special skills of your heroes and units to gain an edge on the battlefield.\r\n● Expand your castle, upgrade your army and recruit specialized units.\r\n● Each of the available races have well-balanced units and features, ensuring a unique strategy and making the battles more exciting and varied.\r\n● A single-player skirmish mode featuring the heroes of each campaign.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Beat your friends' best times in amazing locations such as China, Yosemite National Park, Iguazú Falls or The Golden Gate in San Francisco. Race through canyons in Australia, test your skills in the most wonderful glaciers of Argentina, or immerse yourself in the most beautiful forests of Spain. \r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n✔ Awesome graphics\r\n✔ Very realistic physics\r\n✔ Real bike and quad models: 125cc, 250cc, 450cc... 2-Stroke and 4-Stroke engines\r\n✔ Amazing worldwide locations (27 different tracks in 9 locations)\r\n✔ Leaderboards and achievements\r\n✔ In-game Camera feature to take pictures\r\n✔ Game-pad and keyboard support\r\n\r\nEnduro racing is a somewhere between MX and Trials sports. You ride in outdoor locations on a time-based race. The goal is to complete each round as fast as possible, but World Enduro Rally will give you bonus time if you perform stunts like backflips, frontflips (and other hidden stunts), and will add penalty time each time you re-spawn.\r\n\r\nEnduro bikes are heavy, and controlling tilt is sometimes hard. They don't brake much either, so you need to plan your speed carefully. The game includes speed signs to give you tips about when you can drive fast, or when you should drive slowly. \r\n\r\nMore bikes and locations will keep coming! \r\n\r\nWe’re on Twitter (@WEnduroRally) and Facebook (@worldEnduroRally).","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1Z1WG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toon Wars","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44666.13510798886189411.2878d725-9a9e-40fd-a9d4-fe761f3144a6.1d662abc-987a-4781-b296-8f8092e73b11","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.842.13510798886189411.0a47e2e8-15bb-4ba4-978d-26d35dcc4c72.5916e3e8-3b6f-4c88-971c-6a2b5e098d3a","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50319.13510798886189411.b2e0e360-e2d8-4772-aefe-6dfe9509dca3.eafa4896-fa43-46a3-8fb8-53d5b7c51412","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5507.13510798886189411.fbd0acae-e0bf-426d-a018-f41c1dbee20c.531f5281-2be1-4b5c-9562-d6d07952f020","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40407.13510798886189411.0dd28eb2-837e-4236-a7d1-7a4b95413df3.e033740e-b280-434a-b701-b5471d92853c","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9988.13510798886189411.f98f2c8c-ebb4-433e-a0f3-f75650c6524b.16824856-28d3-4d06-81ea-41a3d68608b1","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2229.13510798886189411.a8aeb627-13df-4ecd-8f5e-d881e77cead9.e1fb408c-6262-4472-a681-6c95ff502fba","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47210.13510798886189411.713de41a-a7a1-49ae-80a4-4549a08d5c53.02d5eb92-57d0-431a-aac8-103f9c722f99","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10104.13510798886189411.286fc1dd-3ebc-43b6-a0b7-b16f329e9d37.431c5fb5-ebb2-4dbf-afac-3a40a835d45b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1660.13510798886189411.cf84b9e0-1d12-449d-a570-6eb0f4491237.ee914db3-f3df-416a-b07c-fe8d195e1b9a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"36","PackageFamilyNames":["23866ExtremeDevelopers.ToonWars_zxxvj7ezs5pcc"],"ContentIds":["fa130a81-5a25-2214-bb33-d36d50d1d2d1","203ad3f3-9fe4-0aa5-fa85-d08eba978093","10b3f658-d9c7-44f4-27be-0874ea76a4e2","cb6e4a78-ec1f-ac17-1ebc-87611bc24116"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Exciting online tank battles.\r\n\r\nCartoonish real-time tank battles!

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nRocky Horror, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons (Or the corner game board icons, a real help for smaller screens) or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Coin slot found at the top right of the fruit machine). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail. The game also has retro sound effects, all in all, a lot of real retro fun in one retro fruit machine-happy retro gaming!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P72C59V8WP9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Business World: Monopoly Board Game Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12862.14612910058651148.455d0569-758c-4784-b935-44fd950aaec6.a094a461-b0ae-4e5e-8cb3-f0599b853627","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23225.14612910058651148.455d0569-758c-4784-b935-44fd950aaec6.1e19a63d-0147-4adf-8063-b7d4cc96f8c9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64726.14612910058651148.ffefdccd-1cbb-4045-b9c9-ac7cca0c581d.1372887c-8f1a-44e5-9112-a83fe556cbe9","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£3.09","Price":3.09,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["50483MicroGames.BusinessWorldFamilyBoardGame_gkngqq7ztxek8"],"ContentIds":["59f6909e-261f-76aa-90c1-974fbffc91bb","1d5c40c3-0b4a-9623-8c49-87d1f57a4d37"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Embark on a journey to own it all - The Business Board: Monopoly family board Game!

After all, they have so many beneficial vitamins. And each of them is unlike the other. Red, blue, and green, large and small, hard and soft. Some are sweet, others sour, and still more are salty. You might think that each fruit has its own personality. Merry strawberries, clumsy cabbages, and carefree oranges. I wonder what they would be like if they could live among us? We decided to indulge our imaginations and presented each fruit in its own characteristic way. The result turned out to be very interesting and fun!\r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MWSK4MB66QZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bingo Win!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4948.13833429596646974.421c2cfd-c0ce-424a-a3e3-d096476e2662.2c05f34c-c85b-4343-aa3f-ee11b7944ab7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53039.13833429596646974.421c2cfd-c0ce-424a-a3e3-d096476e2662.fd6bdeb6-accb-4f98-bb98-c0a916ba1d72","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["50559illDov.BingoTest_x74b8zkdj9qfw"],"ContentIds":["780290df-9eec-5637-737a-5bc327c321b8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*** Come & play the #1 Free Bingo Games : Bingo Win! ***\r\n\r\nJoin Winnie to start an interesting Bingo Journey now!
