This was the first return, in earnest, of the Western Allied powers to the continent of Europe since the disastrous withdrawal of the BEF from France in 1940.\r\n\r\nTwo armies were involved: The US 7th Army, commanded by Patton, and the British 8th Army, commanded by Montgomery. They faced a variety of Axis formations, from demoralised Italian coastal defences to tougher German mechanised troops, remnants of the Afrika Corps and Italian elites.\r\n\r\nThis game allows you to play either the Allied invasion, or the Axis defenders. The aim of the Allies is to capture the 3 principle cities of Sicily (Catania, Palermo and Messina) as quickly as possible. The Axis must prevent this.\r\n\r\nYou can either play another person hot-seat, or either side against your device.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 options you can set:\r\nAllied reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more reinforcements from the historical floating reserves.\r\nAxis reinforcements: Fewer than historical, or more German and Italian reinforcements could be sent.\r\nLanding site: The historical site chosen was not the original one - there was an alternative Western site.\r\n\r\nIn all, there are 147 selectable combinations, plus you can set any of the options to a random choice for a more exciting, unpredictable game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRD348N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Solitaire#","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10259.9007199267189627.414811d3-a46d-4bc0-a811-b19a567a3cb3.25003f05-47e9-4622-a630-487976335a15","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ffa500","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24836.9007199267189627.68c35601-cbfe-4ed0-9de9-f54e64fa3714.994fd8a9-8f39-4fb4-a88b-1f7d10e8e0eb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ffa500","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["62550BestAppsGames.Solitaire_mm1a12ff75xgw"],"ContentIds":["c6d6a030-ca75-4ff4-f505-5d8d3be2e1e1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A windows metro version of popular solitaire game.\r\n\r\nCan you pass all 30 levels?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDC9TX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Shanghai Snooker","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3171.9007199266361361.a7fbf726-1c21-453c-8abd-0b50e48e02b9.748fcb58-a617-4b4c-8061-8a85b7120cc0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#006000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$4.99","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["28861RESETgame.ShanghaiSnooker_35b8x47qztent"],"ContentIds":["a7e20abd-4053-6884-71ff-dc4dfffbdfe3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Forced to flee Las Vegas due to economic collapse, the hustlers from RESETgame's Vegas Pool Sharks have decamped to the new world capitol of gambling: Macau.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDJ2S5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Star Shipping Inc.","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35799.9007199266483866.13f05447-4c2f-4bec-b178-7171b6726050.d2bb8dea-1418-4eee-9043-a06f4f033eff","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56477.9007199266483866.6bfd36b5-24ae-48b1-9351-289eac63e0aa.a7c244bd-bc1d-40ba-ae3a-72d8c68181f8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["6D0669D6.31597E28EE017_qvtjws96jvq8y"],"ContentIds":["df335699-d0d3-d622-a429-5afb91c00a8d","f96c04f9-ee3e-54ac-f82b-c01fb8469ec1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Mobiel","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Travel through space and get rich with Star Shipping Inc.

Doing this with more suns and planets you can eventually compose your own track, it can be as long as you want and have as many samples of music as you need to become your very own space DJ!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKKWF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Simply Pinochle","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38717.9007199266525172.4a78381e-78b3-49fa-b756-5387507cee85.fcdaf380-1722-447b-b0ce-8d91c582c542","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.29","Price":2.29,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["38236CardsFun.SimplyPinochle_wvhqmvdkxmhhc"],"ContentIds":["f298a4df-668f-bd36-9fe4-055b49d2cd1c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pinochle is an exciting and challenging game of cards very popular in the U.S. This is the two handed version of the game in which you play an intelligent robot.

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and was the direct cause of the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again. \r\n\r\nMagic Age 1053\r\nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun, the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes. Humiliated and infuriated by these abuses, the humans begin to resist and fight back. \r\nIt starts as a rash of disorganized, sporadic riots. But it soon grows into something more, something meaningful. These uprisings become a beacon of hope to all humans, spurring them on to unite and form a new empire. They choose a name to reflect their most noble traditions, to reflect a time when they ruled over the demon horde. They call it the Reformed Simba Empire. \r\n\r\nPetun?little more than a bump in the road, a mark on a map. But this is where it all started, where the undercurrent of disdain and hatred overflowed into a bloody torrent of death and destruction, drowning Neverland in war for years to come. \r\nThis is where our story begins?the story of the Seven Year War.\r\n\r\n* This game does require a Microsoft XInput controller if not played on a touch enabled Tablet device.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ942","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ultimate Scrabble Solver","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21180.9007199266257705.f5894ed6-878e-43af-9f1b-c986e353e6f9.3c6a073b-87c1-4e11-a77c-9a72a792640a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1102.9007199266257705.449b55c7-4640-4a74-9545-7bb44a77f680.670a53fb-da1a-4cd0-ae1e-ef545983465a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33882.9007199266257705.c9397073-4431-4f89-8817-31d925acd250.8a81fcb8-2ed5-4f00-8bc6-1bfa608c2475","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58186.9007199266257705.488a38b9-4d5a-4980-948c-3539ff3302fb.a2abcee0-4078-4ae7-b80c-bbb452736ebe","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.49","Price":1.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["21387pmalik.UltimateScrabbleSolver_8wf7cm996bgty"],"ContentIds":["22832b46-f4b9-1a5a-01bd-171e961c0589"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Find solutions for your Scrabble game.

But, despite the fact that it has been 2 years since she came out of the coma, she is haunted by the promise of Sandman to take revenge. Laura and Tim go to ski resort hoping to distract Laura from heavy thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere, on the edge of the world, misfortune befalls her. Tim goes out of the house in a fit of lunacy and falls off the cliff. He did not die, but is in a coma. It is not hard to guess that the fall off the cliff and coma are caused by intrigues of the Sandman.\r\n\r\nIt would seem what might be easier for Laura, having the absolute Power, to awaken her husband? However, being received the Power, Laura has made a commitment not to use the Power for her own benefit. This means that she can’t help Tim to wake up. And she has 2 choices: watch how her beloved slowly dies in the hospital, or have recourse to the help of an old friend again who once helped her when she was in a coma.\r\n\r\nWhen Laura met an old friend (the player), she stops the time to pass by the doctors unchecked and infiltrate in Tim’s ward, and then she immerses the player into the subconscious of Tim, whose body is almost seized by the Sandman.\r\n\r\nThe Sandman operates under the old scheme: by sending nightmares, he suppresses the will of the victim to resist.\r\nWill the player have time to wake up Tim before the Sandman turns him into his heir?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MTGQMSL2DSD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"KILL THE EMOJI","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28553.13812922047902395.ec4bedd7-039c-44d2-9669-f9c49f1e7c13.aa8804c5-0fea-400d-9e79-db5225cff44c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44923.13812922047902395.e6632c90-2aac-4749-bca1-3d732b1e57a1.040ae99e-c6bb-4543-bc14-c3df0aeefe88","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15144.13812922047902395.2aacca91-4b07-4c63-b7cd-dae3b2b7e989.ae1d96fc-2ac8-4896-b7eb-1226826ee079","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58055.13812922047902395.7becd9c2-2f9a-4009-9f69-0778aefe17f5.51ee1706-e737-4b30-9821-845ce56ca184","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["11851DRUNKENAPES.KILLTHEEMOJI_kr6e3z7mf4bvr"],"ContentIds":["04138f98-e734-a5f3-9ad3-160fa6d26f68","75494704-91d6-2ad0-db2d-aaf8dff9a3b3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"IF YOU EVER WANT TO SHOOT HORDES OF EMOJIS?

They are also known for its art, architecture, and mathematical and astronomical systems. Every new discovery about them is very important because it is a testimony about a really advanced and unique civilization, much more advanced than the rest. That's why the territory where they lived is visited by numerous scientists, always looking for something more about its culture and the life of the Mayas in general.\r\n\r\nIn this game you will meet Juanita who is a professional photograph and an archeologist. She is a free lancer and she always like to learn and see something new, without being bounded to some particular duty. One day, all of a sudden, when she was taking pictures of the nature, she has discovered something really special. Believe it or not, she bumped into ruins from the famous Maya civilization, some buildings that weren't discovered before. Even though she wasn't looking for them at the moment, this discovery is huge and very important for an archeologist like her.\r\n\r\nJuanita is very excited by her discovery so starts a detailed investigation right away. She likes to explore each spot of this place and take picture of every place and every object that seems important for the discovery.

This girl likes to explore things, likes to see something new and enjoys adventures so much. At this moment she is in Egypt. Actually she is in the south part of Egypt, near the city known as Luxor, in the area Abul Nagaa. She has come there because she believes that the ancient tombs in this place are not sufficiently explored. She thinks that the tombs are actually forgotten and someone has to see what is hiding there.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit to the tombs in Luxor, Nicole realizes that he was right in her assumptions because very soon she starts discovering new things. Namely, she starts finding a lot of valuable objects including eight mummies undiscovered until now. This seems like a really important discovery but the findings don't stop here. Additionally Nicole discovers small statues that weren't found before in Egypt or on any other place around the world. She knows that her discovery is huge so she goes more into details and continues exploring every possible place really carefully.\r\n\r\nLet's look around together with Nicole and see what those tombs hide. This would definitely be an interesting adventure so we like to share it with you and give you one excellent experience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money.

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy. Hints are displayed to help you decide whether to Bet, Raise, Call, or Fold. The Strategy Mode gives you more information about your hand and your odds of improving. You also have the option of seeing your opponents’ cards during the deal! \r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or enjoy the program, please let us know!

Unfortunately, these alternative universes contain spheres that wish to turn everything round, so it’s up to Lucas to save the world from these dangerous aliens: the Spheroids.\r\n\r\nThroughout Spheroids' 32 levels, you’ll encounter many different environments, with multiple hazards to avoid and enemies to destroy.

Symptoms can include light-headedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, momentary loss of awareness, and loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.\r\nImmediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these\r\nsymptoms.

Through the story mode you'll progressively unlock all the weapons, secondary weapons and perks available to configure your ship. You'll need them to face the increasingly hard enemies you'll find with over 30 different types (including 4 bosses).\r\n\r\nIn Tachyon Project you take control of Ada, a software program that has taken conscience and that was designed to hack into the most secure servers on Earth.

Notes: - MineChat does not work with servers that require client modification such as Tekkit. - MineChat will work over 3G/4G, but eats up a good bit of data and can run slow depending on your connection. So it is recommended you are on WI-fi when in using MineChat. - MineChat does not support Forge Modloader servers. - MineChat sends a spawn command automatically upon connection to help prevent your character from getting killed while using the app. However, not all servers support the spawn command or have delay before teleporting you which leaves your character vulnerable during that time period. Be sure you are aware how your server handles spawning. Security: MineChat does not send any credentials or information of any kind to any third party servers. The only information transmitted is directly to Minecraft servers. It uses the exact same login method as the Minecraft game uses. It transmits login credentials over SSL and uses encryption while transmitting game data.

Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5XZHT","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Metal Animal Slug","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29973.13510798886405816.0264a182-1fc2-4f50-b146-04d52bed7f9c.069436e1-60a3-493f-85bd-3d3830f09de6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33392.13510798886405816.60946d2f-ddaf-434f-b045-5babc26f56c1.7d473a49-dd3a-4ff0-9541-2225d5e64f45","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["24670C06802E.MetalAnimalSlug_nvwr3kmjgkn18"],"ContentIds":["6ea26e77-dd84-a3c0-242b-8c045cef1034"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Control a team of cute and furry pets with weapons, and defend the tank from the enemy invasion. \r\n\r\nStop the evil animals from destroying your metal tank!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH69PQM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Country Ramble Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49050.13510798886573524.1d7b3b15-7650-4835-995a-d97f052ff530.2b1e01fb-4682-4e20-a8a6-8035fdcfcedd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54928.13510798886573524.f4599ee2-19fe-4045-ab79-9f47ab27ce7f.020eac76-90ff-48ba-ac4f-28bba2c38f3b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["34088MixxusStudio.CountryRambleGames_n714pv7s41yej"],"ContentIds":["2c935615-b3f0-ee9e-c515-1f6236017991"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Walk in the countryside, using Kinect with Windows\r\n•\tThis application requires the Kinect for Xbox One sensor and a Kinect Adapter for Windows.\r\n•\tMake sure your system is compatible with the Kinect for Xbox One sensor with the Kinect Configuration Verifier tool, available in the Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 2.0 at https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect\r\nABOUT THE GAME\r\nIn Country Ramble Games you can with the help of a Kinect sensor take a walk in the countryside. There are three different variations of the game, BubbleWalk, PokerWalk and BingoWalk. You move along the road by walking in place, like a leisurely march. At the same time, you can do some playing tasks with either your right or left hand. In BubbleWalk you pop some bubbles as you walk along the road. Count how many bubbles you can pop. In PokerWalk, you are presented with ten cards along the road, you can pick five of them, you cannot change or return a card so try to choose wisely to get a good poker hand at the end of the road. If you have something on your hand, you can save the result, so if you want, you can try to collect different types of hands. In BingoWalk you control a magic beam with your hand. Find the five Bingo objects along your way, and aim your beam at the objects to collect them. But be careful, the objects will start to drift upwards as soon as you point your beam at them. If you get Bingo, you can save your time result.\r\n\r\nTYPE OF GAME\r\nThe Country Ramble Games are intended both as recreation and as a way to get exercise in a simple way. Note that these are not extreme action games. Country Ramble Games can be played by people with impaired mobility as well as people who want a little more than an ordinary walk, just level the step height button. The step height button determines how high you need to lift your feet or knees to get around. You can change the step height level to your preference. At the lowest setting it's easy to get around, this may be a good setting for elderly or people with some kind of mobility impairment. There are no time limits, if you feel like it, you can stop and rest outside the mediaeval chapel and listen to some hymns, you can turn down the game music volume and just listen to the birds, or why not pump up the step height level and turn the music volume up and get a really good exercise. Of course, you don't actually need to \"play\" anything if you don't want to, just walk and relax.\r\n\r\nWHO CAN PLAY\r\nThis game can be played by anyone who wants to take a leisurely walk or stroll in the countryside, one can even \"walk\" sitting down which makes it useful for elderly or for people with some form of mobility impairment. For those who want a more intense and difficult march, increasing the Step Height level will for sure make the pulse go up.\r\nThe games are simple in their design and will suit people also with less experience in computer gaming. The games are intentionally made to be cognitive non-demanding to suit people in need for relaxed activities. They may be a good choice for people with cognitive difficulties, such as in stress related fatigue syndrome where attention can be easily overwhelmed by stimuli, or for people with brain fatigue or minor dysfunctions caused by stroke. There are no \"bells and whistles\" in the games, at least very little, the scenes takes place in nature in a calm environment and the music consists of a mix of old folktunes (walking tunes), classical pieces with a somewhat modern arrangement. (Generally, \"Country Ramble Games\" were designed to be less stressful and less physically demanding than some common motion games.) The games has been developed with the support of psychological expertise. \r\nAs results can be saved and viewed in plotted graphs or in high score tables, the games could also be useful in a clinical context, such as in stroke rehabilitation and physiotherapy, since you can easily view progress in training. And the games can hopefully be a fun way of training a weak leg or arm. In such cases, discuss game playing with your medical advisor. For people suffering from problems with balance or mobility impairment such as weakness in legs, one can play sitting down.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need an adapter. After installation of Kinect you should have the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 installed in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Country Ramble Games.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\nTo make sure the game runs well on your system, you can download the free demo version before buying the full game. Download free demo (Country Ramble DEMO) at Windows Store or get more info at http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed, see above under \"Technical stuff\"\r\n•\tStart the game by pressing the Country Ramble Games icon. \r\n•\tFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants and press one of the correspondent buttons underneath to play with either right or left hand. \r\n•\tStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, the blue screen layer will disappear.\r\n•\tWalk in place, that is, march on the spot, lifting your feet and knees a little. \r\n•\tMove either your right or left hand (depending on which hand you've chosen) to pop bubbles, pick cards or point beam at bingo items. \r\n•\tWhen you're done, you will be taken to the Orientation Board. From the Orientation Board Menu, you can either restart or choose one of the two other games. You choose either by putting your hand in one of the boxes or use the mouse to click.\r\n•\tIf you choose to go back to the Main Menu start screen, you can click on Result to view your result under any of the five player icons. (If you have saved any result.)\r\n\r\nPlaying the game variations:\r\n•\tBubbleWalk: As you walk, there will be bubbles appearing in front of you, sometimes shooting up way ahead of you, to reach them you will have keep a steady pace. Don't worry if you can't, as long as you walk and don't stand still, bubbles will keep appearing along the road. Try to pop the bubbles by reaching out at them with your hand.\r\n•\tPokerWalk: Ten cards will be placed along the road. try to get a poker hand by choosing wisely. When you're in reach to pick a card, a little sound can be heard. To pick a card, hold up your hand, a red lightbulb will show up around the card, keep holding your hand up for about 3 sec, and the card will show up in the panel at the bottom of the screen. Once you picked a card you cannot change it. If you don't want a card, just pass it. When you've picked five cards, you cannot pick any more card. The type of hands you can get (in order of value) is; one pair, two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, and royal flush. If you get some of those hands and your cards are high you can also get bonus points added to the total sum. Both the type of hand and the total sum will be recorded if you choose to save your results.\r\n•\tBingoWalk: Five objects will show up on the panel at the bottom of the screen. As you walk along the road, try to spot those items (sometimes they are easy to see, sometimes not so easy). When you find them, point your magic beam towards them and they will start to float upwards. To catch the objects, hold your beam so it turns red, try to follow the object with your hand so the beam keeps being red for about 3 sec.  If you catch it, it will be checked in your panel. Tip; try to get close to the objects, at long distances or far to the sides, it can be hard to point and keep the beam steady enough. If you miss an object, you will get a second chance at the end.\r\n\r\nMORE INFO:\r\nDownload free Demo version at: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\nSee Video Tutorial on how to play on: https://youtu.be/SeVz1uzxqZg\r\nDownload PDF Tutorial for more in details on how to play at: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6C7HN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"1010#","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21300.13510798886614269.4495dd79-34d4-4344-b066-81cf5ce20b27.ad194bf3-3b4e-49fd-b1ac-888e2c1c2177","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61789.13510798886614269.dd04cfe8-c619-4429-8bbf-86a97abf0521.28351a0b-3304-4ebc-a87c-65d5ddc9e3c9","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["55539SmartLLC.1010_hn124w4302a92"],"ContentIds":["f830e4cf-9402-ac53-ee4e-36b5d61fad5a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"An addictive board game。\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\nPlace the blocks on the screen and form complete lines horizontally or vertically. \r\n\r\nColors don't have to match.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CP3G","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Letter Sounds Song and Game™","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14240.13510798886618115.c6466d69-fe7b-4ec1-b2d1-876fdf1bd77f.921b39d1-5700-4286-aea4-daa7bdc0091a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2932.13510798886618115.cf5ab728-1eda-4426-801d-a73134e69e58.9319e599-5b38-4d83-9adb-a12aa18e94ab","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["E5CEBA72.LetterSoundsSongandGame_sek193xj0qzgc"],"ContentIds":["bb6fafb7-c8a1-df24-b80b-390f0beed5b7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Learn Beginning Phonics with Letter Sounds Song and Game™ - The fast, fun, and effective way to learn phonics! \r\n\r\nThis software uses our popular Letter Sounds Song™ to teach students letter sounds.

To conquer as much territory as possible. It's initially very simple, and the game can be mastered immediately, but watch out: there's competition, and not everyone can win!\r\nWhether you're bold or more careful, you have to be more cunning than your adversaries by finding the best strategy to conquer the most space. But be careful! You have a weak spot: your tail. If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.\r\nTry to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.\r\nAfter the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io). Enjoy the simplicity and strategy of an io game in a world with unique graphics.\r\nPaper.io is for the whole family and doesn't require an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis player will allow you to open your favorite web games inside a self-contained UWP app.  This allows better performance, privacy, and security.  Download all your favorites: diep io (diep.io), Zombs Royale (zombsroyale.io), Agario (agar.io), Slitherio (slither.io), Paper.io (paper.io) and tons more directly from the Windows Store!  Note that  you are paying for the player itself, not the game.  The game can be accessed through a browser normally, but our player provides a more hands-free solution.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NCB3SFJCF8K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"God of Light: Remastered","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17151.13571742767748570.0405fffd-36c4-40e2-9bef-389d28becbeb.14a35eb4-cc2f-4668-af19-0eba91054599","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39853.13571742767748570.be0ccd12-deb0-4b63-b4e4-90e0104ec8c5.db706e4b-ef62-4365-83a0-c62a68f302f2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5809.13571742767748570.7d7d4cfc-885f-47a8-b77d-61ff8fce0b0b.dd5526f4-83f3-4f20-a803-88bfc79c38e7","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32818.13571742767748570.80fe28a9-d9e2-4a4d-a216-a60d19f1191d.3af707fb-79e2-4594-bef7-95d68685ea61","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Playmous.22175CEBB1394_mqcchv6w0vt2w"],"ContentIds":["b43d5ab7-6f4b-e29c-c835-01f5f986cdb5","d77e3d79-cbe0-308a-31c4-99a68dfd5cd6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"God of Light: Remastered is a definitive version of the original award-winning game played by over 15 million people.

But for some people working together can be really beneficial. Especially if their work is their biggest pleasure which means that two people combine their biggest pleasures and that can result with a great and successful result.\r\n\r\nJoan and Patrick are a married couple. Those two are real adventurists that are obsessed by the mysteries of the ancient Egypt. They live and work together but their job is a real pleasure without any unnecessary stress, which means everything is just perfect between them. Now they have a new passion and they are prepared to go together through this new adventure.\r\n\r\nAccording to the texts found back in the 19th century, the well-known Sphinx wasn't build 5000 years ago. Actually it was restored in that time, but it was built many years ago. Joan and Patrick are convinced that the pyramids were built together with the Sphinx.

The game is safe for all ages but comes without all the distractions that games for kids usually have. Anyone with a taste for puzzle and mind games should give A Game of Lines and Nodes a try. The game does not require any special permissions in your device, works offline and has no ads.\r\n\r\nThe game involves playing with lines and dots (we call them nodes) but is far from being a simple connect-the-dots game. A Game of Lines and Nodes combines elements of Hashi or Hashiwokakero (橋をかけろ, literally translated to “build bridges!”), plus some features that make it unique, engaging and relaxing.\r\n\r\nThe game is somewhat similar to Hashi in that the nodes have a required number of connections and in that lines cannot jump over nodes or other lines. However, nodes here are 'floating' and can be dragged around freely. Also, there can only be one connection between the same two nodes, unlike Hashi where there can be up to two.\r\n\r\nAs the nodes get connected, polygons and figures takes form, helping you to determine if you are in the right track to solve the puzzle. Just watching nodes react to each other as they are dragged around contributes to the relaxed environment and is quite entertaining.\r\n\r\nThere are no timers in this game, or any other element or mechanic that will make you feel rushed or under pressure. You can take as long as you like to complete a level, you can even save the state of a puzzle and complete it in more than one play sessions.\r\n\r\nA Game of Lines and Nodes is designed to be as hard or as easy as you want it to be. You can test your might by playing a level without any help and you may succeed, specially after you are more experienced. However, help is always available if you choose to use it.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads, no subscriptions and no in-app purchases. Also, the game is safe for all ages and  the simple interface and controls will appeal to both young and mature audiences.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese (中文) and the language can be changed at any time from the Welcome screen. \r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n  • Easy to learn and play but challenging\r\n  • Relaxed no-rush environment\r\n  • No ads, no subscriptions, and no in-app purchases\r\n  • No internet connection needed to play\r\n  • Does not require special permissions in your device\r\n  • Safe for all ages\r\n  • Clean and minimalist user interface\r\n  • Option to pause and continue later\r\n  • Original game elements like unbreakable connections, incompatible nodes and more\r\n  • Almost impossible to get stuck in a level with the help system\r\n  • Over 50 challenging levels\r\n  • Background selection and an option to mute sounds\r\n  • Can be played in English, Spanish or Chinese (中文)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NKG7SCF484R","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hidden Object : Monaco Nights","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44659.13657367354109720.fe44f5a0-b000-4fbc-a0f6-b0165b47713d.0c6438ba-03a6-4cc7-853c-a2b64534def5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57457.13657367354109720.fe44f5a0-b000-4fbc-a0f6-b0165b47713d.eb45518c-28be-49bd-be6c-df1928cd34c8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23882.13657367354109720.fe44f5a0-b000-4fbc-a0f6-b0165b47713d.90cf90b2-f216-49c1-8f04-80028f5e9fd6","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49877.13657367354109720.fe44f5a0-b000-4fbc-a0f6-b0165b47713d.ae0ec032-e840-46d6-8fd2-c30b77523e13","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["63539WhatYJ.HiddenObjectMonacoNights_snqt1gdtj7vq4"],"ContentIds":["001e4170-893e-d95e-e145-50cae0bf4785","6622771d-55ab-1bc8-9da4-d3441842e311"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"Pc","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"An addictive hidden object game about monaco nights.\r\n\r\nFind and spot the given hidden object.\r\n\r\nThis fast way of living doesn't leave us too much time for friendships.
